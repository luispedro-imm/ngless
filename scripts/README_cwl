In order to generate .cwl files from the python scripts I used:

    https://github.com/erasche/argparse2tool

Installed on a conda environment with python3.5.

Run:

    argparse2tool_check_path

and follow instructions to setup the environment to use the tool.

Once setup simply run:

    ./mytool.py --generate_cwl_tool

and a file called `mytool.cwl` should now exist in the current directory.

NOTE: The '--debug' option was also left in as it may prove useful for debugging.
